## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project gave me more experience in working with flexbox and grid in css. I used a combination of both to control the overall macro layout as well as micro layout.

### Useful resources

- [Web.Dev Learning](https://web.dev/learn/css/) - This helped me with learning flexbox and grid as well as media queries. I will continue using this resource to further my web development knowledge.
